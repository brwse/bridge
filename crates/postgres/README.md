# postgres-bridge

**Experimental** package as part of the Brwse open-source project.

This package provides a PostgreSQL protocol bridge, allowing you to wrap any PostgreSQL database in an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for secure and flexible integration.

## About

Brwse is building a suite of tools to enable secure, authenticated, and deterministic/LLM-based middleware for HTTP and database protocols. This package is a core component for bridging PostgreSQL databases into the Brwse ecosystem.

## Usage

To use this bridge, you must sign up with our service and register your bridges. Without registration, you can still use the server aspect to wrap PostgreSQL endpoints in an MCP.

## Roadmap

- Authentication handling
- Deterministic and LLM-based middleware
- Support for MCPs and Browsers
