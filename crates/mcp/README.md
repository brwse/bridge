# mcp-bridge

**Experimental** package as part of the Brwse open-source project.

This package provides an MCP bridge, enabling you to wrap any MCP service in a Brwse-secured [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

## About

Brwse is building a suite of tools to enable secure, authenticated, and deterministic/LLM-based middleware for HTTP, MCP, and database protocols. This package is a core component for bridging MCPs into the Brwse ecosystem.

## Usage

To use this bridge, you must sign up with our service and register your bridges. Without registration, you can still use the server aspect to wrap MCP endpoints in an MCP (although it'd be kind of pointless).

## Roadmap

- Authentication handling
- Deterministic and LLM-based middleware
- Support for MCPs and Browsers
