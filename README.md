# Brwse Bridges

This repository contains a suite of experimental packages for bridging HTTP and database protocols (such as PostgreSQL) into the Brwse ecosystem using [MCPs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). These bridges enable secure, authenticated, and flexible integration of services.

## About

Brwse bridges let you connect LLM agents to tools and data using a secure, policy-enforcing proxy architecture. You can use the server aspect standalone, or unlock advanced features by signing up with Brwse.

## Features with Brwse

- **Enterprise-grade security and control** for LLM automation
- **Intelligent gates**: deterministic and LLM-powered policy checks on every request
- **Anomaly detection** across agent workflows
- **Immutable audit ledger** for compliance and traceability

These advanced features are available to users who register and connect their bridges with the Brwse platform.

## Packages

- **http-bridge**: Bridge for HTTP services.
- **postgres-bridge**: Bridge for PostgreSQL databases.
- **bridge-cli**: Command-line library for building bridge CLIs
- **registry**: Service for registering with Brwse.

## Usage

To use the full capabilities of these bridges, you must sign up with our service and register your bridges. Without registration, you can still use the server aspect to wrap HTTP or database endpoints in an MCP.

## Roadmap

- Authentication handling
- Deterministic and LLM-based middleware
- Support for MCPs and Browsers
